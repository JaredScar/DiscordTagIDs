## Discontinued Documentation
### Version 1.0

Yes yes I know... I only make discord-based scripts. Well, you're damn welcome!

This is a script that added prefixes to ID tags above players :) by using fully discord roles thanks to IllusiveTea!

I also wanna give thanks to MrDaGree for originally creating the script this was adapted onto! You can find that here, https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-changed-player-name-tags-distance-names/19204

You must have this installed and properly working for this script to work --> https://forum.fivem.net/t/discord-roles-for-permissions-im-creative-i-know/233805

#### Commands:
/tag-toggle - Turns off the prefix from being shown for the player (if they have a prefix in their tag)

/tags-toggle - Turns off all tags from being shown above other players for ONLY yourself (good for streamers and/or pictures)

How does the tags look on players? Let's have a look :)

#### How to set up it up
The 1s in this part of the server.lua file must be replaced with the IDs of your discord roles that are equal to the prefix you have associated with it:
```lua
roleList = {
{0, "~w~"}, -- Regular Civilian / Non-Staff
{1, "~r~STAFF ~w~"}, --[[ T-Mod ]]-- 
{1, "~r~STAFF ~w~"}, --[[ Moderator ]]--
{1, "~r~STAFF ~w~"}, --[[ Admin ]]--
{1, "~p~MANAGEMENT ~w~"}, --[[ Management ]]--
{1, "~o~OWNER ~w~"}, --[[ Owner ]]--
}
